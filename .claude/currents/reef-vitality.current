Reef vitality: ecosystem health through content flow
&active

>context
~Reefs function as living indicators of knowledge ecosystem health
~Growth signals come from meaningful human-AI resonance
~Content quality matters - toxic patterns trigger reef responses
~Human voice should strengthen through inference interactions

>facts
+Living systems respond to environmental signals
+Content flow creates health signals: stagnation toxicity thriving
+AI inference resonating with human thought indicates quality assimilation
+Voice consistency emerges from aligned inference inflections
+Toxic content accumulation is reef health problem not storage issue

>decisions
=Vitality measured by content quality flow not volume
=Growth equals inference resonance with human voice not polip count
=Toxic content triggers reef responses: pruning isolation warnings
=Human signal strength is core vitality metric

>signals
!healthy
 +Polips reference each other naturally
 +New content builds on existing patterns
 +Access patterns show sustained engagement
 +Constraints and decisions remain stable

-toxic
 Contradictory polips
 Stale session contexts never accessed
 Low-resonance content created never surfaced
 Voice drift: new content mismatches patterns

>mechanisms
*bleaching: stale content loses surfacing priority
*pruning: auto-archive sustained low vitality polips
*quarantine: flag contradictory content for resolution
*regeneration: calcification merges high-vitality content

>voice
!strengthens
 +Consistent terminology and phrasing
 +Decision polips that hold over time
 +Frequent surfacing of specific polips
 +Natural linking patterns

-weakens
 One-off content never revisited
 Contradictory decisions within short timeframe
 Abandoned threads
 Imported content mismatching voice

>next
*Define toxic content signals
 stale contradictory low-resonance
*Implement vitality scoring
 voice consistency
 inference alignment
 content freshness
*Build reef response mechanisms
 auto-prune low-vitality
 flag conflicts
*Create resonance metrics
 track polips that strengthen vs weaken signal
*Add reef health command
 vitality score
 content flow patterns
 toxic signals
*Implement voice signature tracking
 detect AI inflection alignment
