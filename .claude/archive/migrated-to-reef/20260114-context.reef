Deep research on AI infrastructure landscape (memory as first-class primitive, MCP protocols, OS integration models) followed by biological exploration of reef: calcification triggers (time, usage, ceremony, consensus, genome), polip budding under pressure, layered geology (active/skeletal/fossil/sediment), digital ecology, and federated validation for reef entry.
!Genome encodes which calcification triggers apply; polips can bud and mutate under pressure
!Death model: staleness→fossil, supersession→nutrient cycling, contradiction→skeleton, explicit pruning→deletion
!Attachment via affinity (semantic similarity) + need (demand signals)
!Reef is protected zone with immune response, not open membrane
!Consensus required for entry; quarantine for disputes with escalation option
[ ] Explore quarantine mechanics and dispute escalation procedures
[ ] Move to (C) cross-system portability: minimum viable `.reef` primitive for macOS, Linux, Windows, containers, cloud
[ ] Gap analysis (B): where does AI currently live in existing infrastructure and where are gaps
