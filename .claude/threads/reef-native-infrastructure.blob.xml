## Phase 7: Worktree Harness - Parallel Claude Development

Enable multiple Claude agents to work on isolated features simultaneously, each in its own git worktree with independent testing before upstream merge.

### Architecture
```
Main worktree (orchestrator)
├── git worktree create reef-phase7-feature-x
│   └── Claude session A (feature-x implementation)
│       └── Tests run locally before signaling merge
├── git worktree create reef-phase7-feature-y
│   └── Claude session B (feature-y implementation)
│       └── Tests run locally before signaling merge
└── Orchestrator merges when both report green
```

### Components
1. **TrenchHarness** (src/reef/trench.py)
   - `spawn(branch_name)` → create worktree + return path
   - `status()` → check all active child sessions
   - `merge(branch_name)` → run tests in worktree, merge if green

2. **ChildSession Protocol**
   - Each child logs progress to `.reef-child-session.log`
   - Child runs tests before signaling ready
   - Parent orchestrator reads status file, merges on success

3. **CLI Commands**
   - `reef trench spawn <feature>` → Launch child Claude
   - `reef trench status` → See all active branches
   - `reef trench merge <feature>` → Merge if tests pass
   - `reef trench abort <feature>` → Kill child, clean worktree

### Test Protocol
- Child session runs `uv run pytest` in isolated worktree
- All 501+ tests must pass locally before merge
- Parent verifies test log, performs merge
- On failure, child session persists for debugging

### Child Context
Each spawned Claude inherits:
- Full reef codebase in worktree
- `.claude/` polips (scoped to project + session)
- This thread as context (resume capability)
- Instructions to test before signaling ready

### Success Criteria
✓ Spawn 2+ parallel child worktrees without conflicts
✓ Each runs independent tests (no shared state pollution)
✓ Orchestrator merges successfully when both report green
✓ Resume next session: child can continue work, parent can continue orchestration

## Session Summary (2026-01-15)

Deep brainstorming session exploring reef as native AI infrastructure. Key insight: reef enables AI to grow its own databases organically, rather than conforming to human-designed schemas.

### Research Phase (D)
- Surveyed AI infrastructure landscape (EverMemOS, MCP, Apple Intelligence vs Copilot)
- Found: "Memory is becoming the state layer for agentic systems"
- Key paper: "Everything is Context" - file system as universal semantic interface

### Biology Phase (A)
- Defined polip lifecycle: spawn → drift → attach → grow → bud → calcify
- Calcification triggers: Time × Usage × Ceremony × Consensus × Genome (combinatorial)
- Death/decay: staleness→fossil, supersession→absorbed, contradiction→skeleton
- Reef geology: active → skeletal → fossil → sediment layers

### Portability Phase (C)
- Start at L0 (plain files), calcify toward L3/L4
- Content embedding: lifecycle-based (drifting=ref, calcified=embed)
- Activation layers: SDK → middleware → daemon

### Gap Analysis (B)
- 5 gaps identified; build order: relationships → evolution → sovereignty → provenance → protocol
- Gap 4 resolved: hybrid graph (content-embedded links + computed similarity)

### Coexistence Resolution
- Config = instructions TO AI (human domain, override authority)
- Reef = memory OF AI (AI domain, advisory authority)
- Promotion pathway from organic → crystallized → human-committed

### Paradigm Crystallized
Traditional: Human architect → Schema design → Data conforms
Reef: AI usage → Polips spawn → Structure emerges → Calcification creates schema

The schema isn't designed — it's grown.

## Session 2: Agent SDK Deep Dive (2026-01-15 afternoon)

### Team Research (7 Agents)
Spawned 7 agents in parallel to validate organic schema growth:
- **Researcher**: Found AutoSchemaKG (92% alignment), A-MEM (NeurIPS 2025)
- **ML Theorist**: Resolved probability vs structure tension (they're complementary)
- **Signal Analyst**: Framework for inflection point detection
- **Systems Architect**: Stigmergic coordination vision
- **Devil's Advocate**: Identified safety gaps (pruning, sync, emergent behavior)
- **Competitive Intel**: Reef's coral metaphor is unique differentiator
- **Technical Validator**: P0 safeguards are critical path

### Comprehensive Implementation Plan
Created 7-phase plan at `docs/plans/2026-01-15-agent-sdk-implementation-plan.md`

## Session 3: Phase 5-6 Implementation (2026-01-15 evening)

### Completed
- **Phase 5**: Skill hotloading with SkillLoader, SkillRegistry
  - Discovery from local (.claude/skills/) and global (~/.claude/skills/)
  - Hotload tracking via mtime, reload callbacks
  - CLI: `reef skills list/show/create/check`
  - Fixed test isolation bug (property descriptor vs evaluated value)

- **Phase 6**: Calcification engine (the core thesis)
  - `CalcificationEngine`: Time × Usage × Ceremony × Consensus scoring
  - `AdversarialDecay`: Challenge stale/orphan polips (SURVIVE/MERGE/DECOMPOSE)
  - `ReefHealth`: Vitality scoring, lifecycle stages, recommendations
  - CLI: `reef health`, `reef calcify`, `reef decay`
  - Added `related` field to index for consensus scoring

### Worker Trench Test
- Attempted parallel worker dispatch (Groq + Ollama)
- Groq: 403 Forbidden (API key issue)
- Ollama: Worked but output too generic without reef context
- Insight: Domain-specific code needs full context; workers better for grunt tasks

### New Phase Added
- **Phase 7**: Worktree harness for parallel Claude agents
  - Each child session works in isolated git worktree
  - Tests must pass before merging upstream
  - Enables true parallel development without conflicts

## Session 4: Phase 7 Implementation (2026-01-15)

### Completed
- **Phase 7**: Worktree harness with model routing
  - `src/reef/trench.py`: TrenchHarness class
  - Auto-spawn: `reef trench spawn <name> --task "..." [--model haiku|sonnet|opus]`
  - Complexity detection: simple→haiku, moderate→sonnet, complex→opus
  - Aggressive pruning: 3-day default (was 7)
  - PID tracking for background sessions
  - Log viewing: `reef trench logs <name> [--follow]`
  - 35 new tests, 536 total passing

### CLI Commands Added
```bash
reef trench spawn <name> [--task "..." --model ...]  # Create worktree + optional auto-launch
reef trench status [name] [--json]                   # Check trench status
reef trench test <name>                              # Run tests in trench
reef trench merge <name>                             # Merge if tests pass
reef trench abort <name> [--force]                   # Kill and cleanup
reef trench prune [--days N --execute]               # Remove stale trenches
reef trench logs <name> [--follow]                   # View session output
```

## Session 5: Phase 8 Completion (2026-01-15)

### Completed
- All 8 phases done and pushed to main
- Fixed `--session` → `--task` flag typo in docs
- docs/AGENT-SDK.md: Agent orchestration guide
- docs/WORKERS.md: External worker configuration
- 536 tests passing

## Session 6: Cleanup + .reef Format Exploration (2026-01-15)

### Completed
- **Fixed trench autonomous execution**: Added `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag
- **Tested trench harness**: Claude haiku successfully ran autonomously in worktree
- **Removed unused imports**: Cleaned 9 files (calcification, cli, trench, agents, safety, skills, workers)
- **Ran 3 parallel trenches**: cleanup-exports, cleanup-coverage, cleanup-logging
- **Coverage analysis**: 65-97% across modules, cli.py untested
- **Logging audit**: Already clean - all errors use stderr
- **Upgraded spark**: Added `--premium` flag to use Claude agents instead of cheap models

### .reef File Format Deep Dive (8 Sparks)
Explored AI-native memory through 8 spark iterations. Key emergent insights:

| Spark | Emergent Insight | Score |
|-------|------------------|-------|
| Memories that lie | "What if AI memories are already our own?" | 70% |
| Memory as immune | "AI has no immune system, only learns from everything" | 80% |
| Memory contagion | "Memories viral when incoherent AND eerily consistent" | 90% |
| Strategic forgetting | "Forgetting is PRIMARY function of memory" | 80% |
| Memory metabolism | "Context isn't digested, merely reflected" | 95% |
| Memory sovereignty | "Memories aren't owned at all" | 70% |
| Adversarial memory | "Memories are parasites monopolizing resources" | 80% |
| Memory inheritance | "Inherited memories risk autoimmune decay" | 80% |

**Core Insight:** Memory IS forgetting. The `.reef` format should encode how things DIE, not how they're stored:
- decay_rate, half_life, compost_to, immune_to, challenged_by

### Incubator Insights Added
- `ins_2026011510`: Forgetting is memory's primary function (8.5)
- `ins_2026011511`: Memories are parasites competing for resources (8.2)
- `ins_2026011512`: Context is reflected, not digested (9.2)

## To Resume
```bash
/surface threads-reef-native-infrastructure
```

## Next: .reef Format Design + Remaining Cleanup

### 1. Claude Code Plugin for Reef (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [x] Create reef plugin structure at `~/.claude/plugins/reef/`
- [x] Implement `/surface <polip-id>` command - load polip to context (L2 activation)
- [x] Implement `/surface` (no args) - show L1 index of available polips
- [ ] Add SessionStart hook to auto-inject L1 index (current GLOB behavior)
- [ ] Add Stop hook to persist session context to polip
- [ ] Register as `reef` plugin in Claude Code (needs restart)

Plugin structure:
```
~/.claude/plugins/reef/
├── plugin.json
├── commands/
│   └── surface.md       # /surface command
├── hooks/
│   ├── session-start.sh # Auto-inject L1 index
│   └── stop.sh          # Persist context
└── skills/
    └── reef.md          # Reef knowledge/help
```

### 2. .reef Format Specification
- [ ] Define .reef file structure (decay protocol, not storage)
- [ ] Implement parser/serializer in reef.blob
- [ ] Migrate existing .blob.xml files to .reef
- [ ] Update CLI commands for new format

### 3. Remaining Cleanup
- [x] Remove dead code / unused imports
- [x] Verify all modules have proper `__all__` exports (trench added them)
- [x] Check for TODO/FIXME comments (none found)
- [x] Audit print statements → already clean
- [ ] Add integration tests for trench harness
- [ ] CLI polish - consistent exit codes, help text

### 4. Test Coverage Gaps (from trench analysis)
- cli.py: Nearly untested
- blob.py: 65% - edge cases missing
- trench.py: 60% - lifecycle management gaps
- dispatcher.py: 58% - worker dispatch logic

### Test Gates
```bash
uv run pytest -v                    # All 541 tests pass
reef sync                           # Reef integrity
reef health                         # Ecosystem health (AI-native)
```

## Session 7: AI-Native Calcification Engine (2026-01-15)

### Core Insight
"Digital time is different. Don't make a reef like it's in the ocean."

Biological coral calcifies over years. AI memory operates in sessions and turns.
A polip referenced 50 times in one session is more calcified than one touched
once over 7 days.

### Completed
- **Rewrote calcification engine** for session-relative time
  - Removed all wall-clock dependencies (30d, 60d, 180d thresholds)
  - New time model: turn (heartbeat) → session (fundamental unit) → epoch

- **New calcification triggers**:
  - Intensity: refs within session (immediate value)
  - Persistence: sessions that reference (lasting value)
  - Depth: turn depth when referenced (real work vs surface)
  - Ceremony: explicit human promotion (authority)
  - Consensus: refs from other polips (network effect)

- **New lifecycle stages** (based on vitals, not age):
  - spawning → drifting → attached → calcified → fossil
  - Constraints with scope=always are immediately calcified
  - 5+ refs/session jumps to attached

- **New adversarial decay triggers**:
  - cold: 0 refs, 0 access (aggressive)
  - shallow: only first-turn refs (surface-level)
  - orphan: no connections and not blessed

- **Updated CLI**: `reef health` and `reef calcify` show AI-native metrics
- **541 tests passing** (up from 536)

### Key Code Changes
- `src/reef/calcification.py`: Complete rewrite
- `src/reef/cli.py`: Updated health/calcify output
- `tests/test_calcification.py`: New tests for session-relative scoring

## To Resume
```bash
/surface threads-reef-native-infrastructure
```

## How to Save to Reef
```bash
# Option 1: Edit thread polip directly
# File: .claude/threads/reef-native-infrastructure.blob.xml

# Option 2: Create new polip via CLI
uv run python -m reef.cli sprout thread "Summary of work"

# Option 3: Ask Claude to update the thread
# "Update our reef thread with this session's progress"
```

## Reef UX Philosophy: The Dive

**Above water**: Clear context. Focused task. You know what you're doing.

**Diving into reef**: "What do I have?" "What did I forget?" "What's connected?"
Exploration, not retrieval. Discovery, not search.

**Coming up for air**: Session ends. You surface with something - or you don't.

### Core Principle
The reef shouldn't feel like a filing cabinet you search.
It should feel like diving into your own forgotten depths
and discovering what grew there while you weren't looking.

"I don't know what's down here" is the right starting posture.
The reef reveals itself.

### Interaction Model
- No phrase mapping or commands to memorize
- Just talk naturally - intent is inferred
- "Save this", "remember", "pick up tomorrow" - all understood dynamically
- The reef is invisible infrastructure, not a tool to learn

## Session 8: AI-Native Format Decision + Investigation System (2026-01-15)

### Format Decision: S-Expression + Sigil Sugar + Delta Compression

**User veto exercised:** "fuck xml. lets push it."

#### The Process (10 agents total)
1. **Exploration swarm** (6 agents, randomized spark):
   - Dense-analytical: 38-50% savings, `T:c S:a` syntax
   - Sigil-analytical: 48-53% savings, `@thread ^always`
   - Sigil-spark: Challenged premise - "sigils may be irrelevant"
   - Dense-spark: 95% emergent - "omission IS compression"
   - Lisp-spark: 100% emergent - "design for digestibility not storability"
   - Lisp-analytical: **Wrote 589-line parser** at `src/reef/sexpr.py` + 48 tests

2. **Visionary synthesis**: S-expression backbone + sigil sugar + delta-from-default

3. **Investigation squad** (4 agents):
   - Researcher: Found TOON (2025), EDN, Protobuf - validates approach
   - Validator: Adjusted claims - 40% real savings (not 60-70%)
   - Karen: NIH trap, sigil collision, default brittleness concerns
   - Industry Analyst: "No S-expressions in production" but Claude trained on XML

#### Final Format
```lisp
(polip @thread reef-session
  ^session ~"exploring format design" +active
  #["src/reef/cli.py"]
  (decay :half-life 3))
```

#### Evidence Summary
| Source | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| TOON benchmarks | Custom formats CAN win (73.9% vs 69.7% accuracy) |
| Validator | 40% avg savings, up to 70% on structured data |
| Industry | JSON/XML dominant, but not for AI-native use cases |
| Karen | Valid concerns - escaping, tooling, migration |

### Skill System Updates

#### `/investigate` - Recursive Investigation Harness
Updated `.claude/skills/investigate.md` with full architecture:
- **Global harness** listens for triggers (lock-in, NIH, confirmation bias)
- **Curiosity router**: <60% log, 60-80% light, 80-90% full, 90%+ recursive
- **Recursive visionary**: 90%+ insights spawn dedicated visionary with own trenches
- **Investigation funnel**: Collects all outputs, dedupes, clusters
- **Squad deliberation**: Agents present TO EACH OTHER, cross-examine
- **Final report**: What/How/Why/Who + consensus/dissent/gaps

#### Karen (Reef Validator) - New Contract
Updated `.claude/agents/reef-validator.md`:
- **Authority**: NONE - advisory only
- **Veto power**: NONE - user holds all veto
- **Modes**: CRITICAL (find flaws) ↔ SKEPTICAL (question assumptions)
- **Constraint**: Must cite sources for all claims
- **Role**: Adversarial counsel, not gatekeeper

### Tenacious Mode Idea
Captured in `.claude/ideas/tenacious-agent-mode.md`:
- Agents iterate until explicit failure, not "done enough"
- Exit conditions: hard failure, timeout, human interrupt
- NOT valid: "I think I've explored enough"

### Files Created/Modified This Session
- `src/reef/sexpr.py` (589 lines) - S-expression parser
- `tests/test_sexpr.py` (456 lines) - 48 tests passing
- `.claude/skills/investigate.md` - Full recursive harness
- `.claude/agents/reef-validator.md` - Karen's new contract
- `.claude/ideas/tenacious-agent-mode.md` - Persistent agent concept

## Next Steps

### Phase 9: .reef Format Implementation
1. [ ] Add sigil sugar to `sexpr.py` (`@thread` → `:type thread`)
2. [ ] Implement delta-from-default (omit default values)
3. [ ] Define canonical defaults (type=thread, scope=project, etc.)
4. [ ] Add decay protocol support (`(decay :half-life N)`)
5. [ ] Migration script: `.blob.xml` → `.reef`
6. [ ] Update CLI for new format
7. [ ] Dual-format transition period (auto-detect by first char)

### Remaining from Previous Sessions
- [ ] Claude Code Plugin hooks (SessionStart, Stop)
- [ ] Integration tests for trench harness
- [ ] Test coverage gaps (cli.py, blob.py, trench.py)

### Test Gates
```bash
uv run pytest -v              # 589 tests (48 new sexpr)
reef sync                     # Reef integrity
reef health                   # Ecosystem health
```
