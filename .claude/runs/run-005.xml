  <summary>Major cleanup: audited 87 uncommitted changes across 4 repos, secured sensitive data, committed infrastructure work (ralph-loop deprecation + investigation/whatif tools), pushed to GitHub, and verified clean state.</summary>

  <what-worked>
    - Opus-based analysis quickly identified actual issues (bot- had .next/ build artifacts, CloudDocs system files)
    - Systematic categorization (commitable vs runtime artifacts) resolved user confusion about 87 changes
    - Security review caught personal legal data in paste-cache before it could be committed
    - Staged commit strategy prevented mixing concerns (deletions → modifications → new features)
    - Infrastructure additions (investigation/whatif) are well-documented and tested
  </what-worked>

  <what-didnt>
    - bot- repo had incorrect remote (nofigg/bot-.git → 404), decision to delete rather than fix was correct
    - RIT repo has no remote; keeping local-only per user request
    - IDE cache still shows context.blob.xml as change even though properly gitignored (cosmetic issue)
  </what-didnt>

  <repos-handled>
    - ~/.claude: 3 commits pushed to GitHub (claude-runtime)
    - ~/Desktop/zoox: 1 commit pushed to GitHub (zoox)
    - ~/Desktop/RIT-Financial-Aid-Appeal-2025-2026: 1 commit local-only (no remote)
    - ~/Library/.../bot-: Deleted (no valid remote)
  </repos-handled>

  <infrastructure-added>
    - /investigate command with multi-phase exploration pipeline
    - /whatif skill with multi-model creative exploration (Groq/Ollama/Gemini spawning)
    - /vera content strategist with link validation
    - Architect, pattern-hunter, scraper agents
    - 48 lenses across 4 categories (objects, patterns, philosophies, constraints)
    - TF-IDF search, wiki linking, LRU tracking, rich templates
  </infrastructure-added>

  <security-notes>
    - paste-cache contains personal custody legal proceedings: NOW PROTECTED via .gitignore
    - .next/ build directory accidentally tracked in bot- repo: REMOVED
    - No API keys or secrets found in committed code
    - All sensitive patterns properly ignored
  </security-notes>

  <next-session>
    <step priority="1">Wire /whatif as invocable plugin skill (currently manual runner)</step>
    <step priority="2">Implement real confidence scoring for /whatif beyond byte-count heuristic</step>
    <step priority="3">Add post-synthesis search integration to /whatif</step>
    <step priority="4">Monitor ~/.claude and zoox repos for future contributions</step>
