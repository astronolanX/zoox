  <summary>AI-native calcification engine: rewrote reef time model from ocean time (days) to session-relative time (turns, sessions, epochs)</summary>

  <what-worked>
    - Complete rewrite of calcification.py with session-based scoring
    - New lifecycle stages based on vitals not age (spawning→drifting→attached→calcified→fossil)
    - Intensity/persistence/depth/ceremony/consensus triggers replace time-based thresholds
    - User insight about "digital time is different" drove entire redesign
    - UX philosophy crystallized: "the dive" metaphor - exploration not retrieval
  </what-worked>

  <what-didnt>
    - Nothing significant - clean implementation session
  </what-didnt>

  <files-created>
    - None (rewrites only)
  </files-created>

  <files-modified>
    - src/reef/calcification.py (complete rewrite - AI-native time model)
    - src/reef/cli.py (health/calcify commands updated for new metrics)
    - tests/test_calcification.py (new tests for session-relative scoring)
    - src/reef/blob.py (archive directory in integrity check)
    - .claude/threads/reef-native-infrastructure.blob.xml (session 7 progress + UX philosophy)
