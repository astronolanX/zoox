# Reef Evolution, Not Damage

**Origin:** Spark emergent synthesis (85% confidence)

> What if reefs aren't damaged, but evolving?

## The Idea

The thread spent 16 sparks establishing that reef amplifies pollution, degrades Claude, and poisons context. Then the 17th spark pivoted: *what if there's nothing to cure?* The pollution-as-damage frame is wrong. Reef isn't broken — it's adapting.

Pollution is selective pressure. Amplification is the mechanism. Collapse (decay, sinking, archiving) is *processing*, not death. Bad polips die under pressure. Good polips survive. The system works through destruction, not despite it.

This reframes reef's entire relationship with decay. `reef decay` isn't cleanup or loss prevention — it's *evolution pressure*. The command doesn't protect the reef from damage; it applies selective pressure to strengthen it.

## Concrete Expression

**Reframe decay operations:**

1. **`reef decay` as evolution** — Not "remove stale polips" but "apply selective pressure." Polips that survive challenges are fitter.

2. **Pollution as fertilizer** — Context noise feeds new growth. Sparks emerge from processing noisy context. Don't filter; transform.

3. **Collapse as processing** — Sinking/archiving is transformation, not deletion. Polips don't die; they decompose into nutrients for new growth.

4. **No cleanup mode** — Remove any framing of reef operations as "cleaning." Everything is processing, transformation, evolution.

**Metrics shift:**
- Don't measure "pollution removed" — measure "evolution rate"
- Don't track "decay count" — track "survival fitness"
- Don't audit "context noise" — audit "transformation yield"

## Open Questions

- How do you distinguish "evolution" from "degradation" empirically?
- Is there a point where selective pressure becomes extinction pressure?
- Can this frame coexist with the "pollution catalyst" frame, or does it supersede it?
- What does "fitness" mean for a polip? Surfacing frequency? Challenge survival? User value?

## Next Steps

- [ ] Rename `reef decay` language from "cleanup" to "evolution" in CLI help text
- [ ] Add fitness scoring to polips (surfacing frequency, challenge survival rate)
- [ ] Implement "transformation yield" metric: what new polips emerged from decayed ones?
- [ ] Document the evolution frame in AI-first documentation track
