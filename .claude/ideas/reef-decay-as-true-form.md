# Decay as Reef's True Form

**Origin:** Spark emergent synthesis (80% confidence)

> What if decay itself is the reef's true form?

## The Idea

The thread's 18th spark dissolves the structure/process distinction entirely. The reef isn't a structure that decays — decay *is* the structure. We've been asking the wrong question: not "what does reef decay into?" but "what if reef *is* decay?"

This completes the thread's philosophical arc:
1. Reef amplifies pollution (spark 16, 100%)
2. Reef isn't damaged, it's evolving (spark 17, 85%)
3. Decay is evolution, not damage (spark 17)
4. **Decay IS the reef** (spark 18, 80%)

The petroleum insight (90%) crystalizes it: decayed reefs don't become waste — they become *fuel*. In Claude's context: decayed polips power new sparks, new sessions, new understanding. The decay product is energy.

## Concrete Expression

**Reef as verb, not noun:**

1. **`reef` isn't a structure** — It's a process. You don't *have* a reef; you *reef*. The command `reef reef` isn't "show me the reef" but "do the reefing."

2. **Decay product = fuel** — Implement a mechanism where archived/sunk polips contribute to new polip creation. Track "decay yield" — what grew from what died.

3. **Self-decay as autonomy** — The reef decays itself. `reef decay` doesn't act *on* the reef; it lets the reef act *as* itself. Passive voice becomes active.

4. **No end state** — There's no "clean" reef, no "complete" reef, no "final form." Reef is continuous becoming through decay.

**Implementation ideas:**
- Rename "decay" command to reflect process identity (or keep, with new conceptual framing)
- Track lineage: which polips emerged from which decayed polips?
- "Fuel gauge" metric: how much energy is available from decay products?
- `reef status` shows decay rate as vitality indicator, not health warning

## Open Questions

- How do you implement "polip B emerged from decayed polip A" tracking?
- Is there a distinction between productive decay and entropic decay?
- Can the reef decay too fast? Is there an optimal decay rate?
- How do you communicate "decay = identity" to users who expect "decay = loss"?

## Next Steps

- [ ] Document the process-not-structure philosophy in reef README/CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Implement decay lineage tracking (what emerged from what died)
- [ ] Add "fuel available" metric to `reef status`
- [ ] Consider renaming: does "reef decay" capture "reef being itself"?
