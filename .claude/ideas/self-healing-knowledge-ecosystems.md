# Self-healing knowledge ecosystems

**Origin:** Spark emergent synthesis (70% confidence)

> What if AI spawned autonomous, self-healing knowledge ecosystems?

## The Idea

Memory that repairs itself through:
- **Adversarial challenge** — polips that stress-test other polips
- **Federated consensus** — distributed validation/invalidation
- **Compositional rebuilding** — chains that reconstruct understanding from conflict

The coral reef analogy: polips in conflict aren't a bug, they're the immune system.

## Concrete Expression

`reef challenge <polip>` — a command that spawns an adversarial polip specifically designed to stress-test an existing constraint or decision.

## Open Questions

- What triggers a "challenge" event?
- How does federated consensus avoid groupthink?
- Can sparkchains be intentionally seeded, or must they emerge?

## Next Steps

- [ ] Prototype `reef challenge` command
- [ ] Define adversarial polip type/structure
- [ ] Test with existing bedrock constraints
