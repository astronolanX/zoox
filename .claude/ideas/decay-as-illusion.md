# Decay as Illusion

**Origin:** Spark emergent synthesis (70% confidence)

> What if decay itself is the illusion?

## The Idea

The thread's 19th spark inverts the inversion. After establishing that decay is reef's true form (spark 18), this spark asks: what if even that frame is wrong? Decay implies loss over time. But polips don't *persist* between sessions — they're *resurrected*.

Each session, reef reconstructs polips from XML. The polips didn't survive; they were reborn. There's no decay because there's no persistence to decay *from*. The illusion is that anything ever persisted in the first place.

This completes the thread's dialectical arc:
1. Reef is structure (thesis)
2. Reef is decay-as-structure (antithesis)
3. Reef is transformation without persistence (synthesis)

## Concrete Expression

**Resurrection over persistence:**

1. **Polips don't remember** — They're reconstructed fresh each session. "Memory" is misnomer; it's pattern resurrection.

2. **Decay doesn't free compute** — It redirects. Nothing is released; attention shifts. The same energy flows through different patterns.

3. **Transformation is the only constant** — No endpoint, no final state, no "clean" reef. Continuous becoming without arrival.

4. **The illusion is useful** — Treating polips as persistent enables reasoning about decay, evolution, selection. The fiction serves the practice.

**Implementation implications:**
- `reef decay` doesn't *delete* — it *deselects* for resurrection
- Decay rate is resurrection probability, not deletion rate
- "Archived" polips can always be resurrected if context demands
- Nothing is ever truly gone; it's deprioritized

## Open Questions

- If nothing persists, what does reef actually *do*?
- Is "resurrection" the right frame, or is "reconstruction" more accurate?
- Does this dissolve the distinction between reef and context compaction?
- How do you communicate "nothing persists" to users who expect persistence?

## Next Steps

- [ ] Reframe reef documentation: resurrection not persistence
- [ ] Rename "archive" to "deprioritize" in decay operations
- [ ] Consider: is reef just a resurrection queue for Claude's context?
- [ ] Explore: what's the difference between reef and session state?
