# Ideas

Captured explorations ranked by FII (Feasibility + Importance + Innovation).

## Scoring

| Score | Feasibility | Importance | Innovation |
|-------|-------------|------------|------------|
| 0 | Requires breakthrough | Nice to have | Already exists |
| 1 | Hard, multi-session | Useful | Minor twist |
| 2 | Medium, single session | Important | Novel combination |
| 3 | Easy, quick prototype | Critical | Genuinely new |

**FII = F + I + I** (max 9)

## By Status

### Captured
Ideas worth exploring, not yet started.

- [[self-healing-knowledge-ecosystems]] (FII 8) — adversarial + federated + compositional memory
- [[adversarial-decay]] (FII 7) — reef decay command with selection pressure for memories
- [[polip-drift-migration]] (FII 7) — autonomous polip relocation based on content affinity
- [[metaphor-death-rebirth]] (FII 7) — coral metaphor may need to evolve or die for digital clarity
- [[composable-operations]] (FII 7) — operations over syntax; Unix pipes as reef's composition layer

### Prototyping
Active development or testing.

- [[spark-to-idea-pipeline]] (FII 7) — capture high-signal sparks as scored ideas
