## Thread Synthesis

First spark in this thread. Key tension: we asked about complexity as gift, the emergent insight flipped it - simplicity might be the real gift. This inversion suggests the thread should explore the **complexity-simplicity duality** rather than treating them as opposites.

Open questions:
- When does complexity become noise vs signal?
- Is "elegant complexity" an oxymoron or the goal?
- What's the minimum viable complexity for innovation?
