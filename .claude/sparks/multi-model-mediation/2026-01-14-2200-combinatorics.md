# Spark: Multi-model combinatorics for high-stakes family law mediation

How can 4 models (Groq tactical, Ollama pattern, Gemini alternative, Claude Opus contextual) create emergent intelligence greater than the sum of parts?

## Memory

Related past sparks:
- 95% │ Without Groq, AI testing becomes phrenology, reading bumps instead of measuring intellect.
- 75% │ In a world where AI learns to forget strategically yet maintains perfect recall across distributed memory
- 75% │ A decaying reef, forced by tidal patterns, becomes a sentient, migratory island-dragon.

| olla1 | 75% | Groq tactical's patterns are forged in conflict, while Ollama's alternatives dissolve into harmony. |

## Insights

The emergent insight is a deliberate inversion: after exploring all the complexity of multi-model synthesis, the strongest signal asks whether we're over-engineering the solution.

**Key tensions surfaced:**
1. **Conflict-forged vs harmony-dissolved** [^1] — Groq's tactical patterns emerge from conflict while Ollama's alternatives dissolve into harmony. This suggests the models shouldn't compete but occupy different *phases* of the mediation process.

2. **Rogue waves of synthesis** [^2] — The tidal patterns tier suggested fractal "rogue waves" where models collapse into non-linear dynamics. This maps to adversarial synthesis: let models attack each other's recommendations until a robust consensus emerges.

3. **Simplicity as emergent property** — The highest emergent signal isn't about adding more complexity but recognizing that four models might converge on simpler truths than any single model would find alone.

**Heretical take:** Perhaps the multi-model architecture's value isn't in *producing* more intelligence but in *validating* simpler conclusions. If all four models agree on a straightforward approach, that's stronger evidence than one model's elaborate analysis.
