# Spark: AI-native sigil-based memory format

## Memory

| Score | Insight |
|-------|---------|
| 95% | Forgetting becomes a feature, not a bug, in a billion minds. |
| 90% | Memories are viral only when they're simultaneously incoherent and eerily consistent. |
| 75% | Polips calcify into calcite, not data, forming a self-healing, porous reef, not a brittle graph. |
| 75% | Groq tactical's patterns are forged in conflict, while Ollama's alternatives dissolve into harmony. |
| 70% | Family law's sieve, when turbo-charged, reveals unseen truths by over-orchestrating AI model dissent |

Top historical lenses: asymmetry, predator-prey, cycles, compass, rearrange, inversion

## Tiers

### -> Near: sourdough starter x engineer
| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq1 | 60% | Stale bread spawns sentient sigils. |
| groq2 | 60% | Implementing a neural network that evolves like a sourdough starter's unpredictable fermentation patterns |
| olla1 | 70% | An AI-native sigil-based memory format exists within a fungal network's hyphal lattice. |
| olla2 | 75% | Sourdough starters predate electricity and digital memory, yet their complexity rivals modern AI-native formats |
| gemin | 35% | A decaying AI memory format, like sourdough, gains unique, essential character over a century of zero-maintenance |

**Synthesis (60%):** Infect AI with sentient fungal sigils that ferment neural networks unpredictably.

## Final Synthesis

| Type | Score | Insight |
|------|-------|---------|
| convergent | 60% | Subverting traditional memory, chaos births intelligent, autonomous systems. |
| divergent | 25% | Order vs Chaos. |
| **emergent** | **80%** | What if sigils are actually irrelevant? |

## Insights

The emergent insight challenges the premise: **sigils themselves may be ceremony we're optimizing for the wrong reason**. The underlying question is whether *any* symbolic prefix system adds value, or whether the AI can parse meaning from structure and context alone.

High-signal from memory [^1]: "Forgetting becomes a feature" — suggests lifecycle/decay should be first-class, not encoded via metadata but emergent from structure.

The fungal network metaphor [^2] implies memory should be connective tissue, not discrete units. Polips as nodes in a mycelium rather than files in a directory.

Provocations:
- What if the "format" is pure prose with learned conventions?
- What if metadata is implicit in position/proximity rather than explicit?
- What if the AI's job is to *infer* type, scope, priority from content?
