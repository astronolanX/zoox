# Spark: Graph-native polip structure for reef

## Memory

- 85% │ Polyps are not parasitized prey but symbiotic predators that exploit human hosts.
- 85% │ Polyps create sentient folders devouring entire databases.
- 75% │ Groq tactical's patterns are forged in conflict, while Ollama's alternatives dissolve into harmony.

## Tiers

### → Near: pressure cooker × visionary
| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq1 | 50% | Polips devour their own metadata |
| groq2 | 75% | Polips calcify into calcite, not data, forming a self-healing, porous reef, not a brittle graph |
| olla1 | 50% | In a pressure cooker, polips calcify into rigid structures that suffocate adaptability |
| olla2 | 50% | Self-replicating memory infrastructure through bi-directional relationships and structural pressure |
| gemin | 60% | Self-organizing memory will calcify into brittle, unadaptable cognitive infrastructure |

**Synthesis (60%):** Disrupt polip calcification to preserve adaptability amidst self-healing, porous, and rigid contradictions.

| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq1 | 65% | We're modeling ocean reef dynamics into AI infrastructure, but neglecting the destructive power of storms |
| groq2 | 50% | Ignoring the polip's intrinsic fragility, we're designing an ecosystem that calcifies the strongest |
| olla1 | 60% | Polips calcify without human intervention |
| olla2 | 40% | Self-replicating memory through social dynamics could lead to infinite loops or echo chambers |
| gemin | 60% | Graph-native polip structure centralizes control, hindering emergence |

**Synthesis (50%):** Disrupt calcification by introducing entropy to prioritize fragile polip resilience over strength.

## Final Synthesis

## Insights

The emergent insight challenges our core assumption: we've been designing explicit structure (links, weights, validators) to enable self-organization. But biological coral doesn't have a graph database — it self-organizes through environmental response, chemical gradients, and local interactions.

**Key provocations:**
1. **Calcification as failure mode** — Multiple models warn that calcified structure becomes brittle, unadaptable. Our "permanent infrastructure" goal may create technical debt.
2. **Porosity over rigidity** — groq2's "self-healing, porous reef, not a brittle graph" suggests we need gaps, dissolution paths, not just growth.
3. **Storms as necessity** — We designed immunity but not destruction. Healthy reefs need periodic disturbance.
4. **Emergence without enforcement** — If polips self-organize through *behavior* (being referenced, being useful) rather than *structure* (explicit link objects), the graph is emergent output, not managed input.

**Adjacent domains:**
- **Stigmergy** (ant colonies): No central graph, just environmental traces
- **PageRank**: Links are implicit in crawl, not stored bidirectionally
- **Neural plasticity**: Synapses strengthen through use, not through metadata

**What we might be missing:**
- Decay as first-class operation (not just archiving)
- Probabilistic relationships (fuzzy edges, not hard links)
- Emergent structure *computed* from behavior, not *stored* as schema
