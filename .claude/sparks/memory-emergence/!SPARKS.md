# Memory Emergence Sparks

Thread exploring: adversarial, federated, and compositional memory systems — how AI memory could become self-healing, distributed, and generative.

## Timeline

## Thread Synthesis

First spark surfaces a compelling direction: memory as immune system. Adversarial polips aren't bugs — they're the mechanism by which stale knowledge gets challenged and replaced. Federation enables consensus, composition enables recovery.

Open questions:
- What triggers a "challenge" event?
- How does federated consensus avoid groupthink?
- Can sparkchains be intentionally seeded, or must they emerge?
