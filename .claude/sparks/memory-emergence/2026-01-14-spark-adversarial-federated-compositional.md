## Insights

The 70% emergent signal is the real takeaway: **self-healing knowledge ecosystems**.[^1]

This isn't just memory that persists — it's memory that repairs itself. When a polip becomes stale or contradicted, the system doesn't just flag it; adversarial polips actively challenge it, federated consensus validates or invalidates it, and compositional chains rebuild understanding from the wreckage.

The coral reef lens hit something real.[^2] Coral doesn't just grow — it recovers from bleaching events through symbiotic relationships. Reef memory could work the same way: polips in conflict aren't a bug, they're the immune system.

Heretical take: **maybe reef should have a `challenge` command** — spawn an adversarial polip specifically designed to stress-test an existing constraint or decision.
