## Insights

The skeptic's warning[^1] is the key signal: "less tokens may mean better sparks, but also more obscured insights." This captures the core tradeoff—compression loses nuance.

The apophatic lens[^2] ("subtract tokens, reveal essence") suggests a via negativa approach: instead of adding features, remove everything that isn't essential. What's the minimum viable spark?

**Concrete reduction paths:**
1. **Rapid mode only**: 3 sparks instead of 9 (already exists via `--rapid`)
2. **Single-model**: Skip multi-model consensus, lose validation but save 2/3 tokens
3. **Structured output**: Force JSON from models, skip prose parsing
4. **Cached lenses**: Pre-compute lens descriptions, don't re-explain each time

**The emergent question** ("tokenlessness sparks unprecedented creativity") inverts the premise—what if constraints force more creative output? Haiku vs novel.
