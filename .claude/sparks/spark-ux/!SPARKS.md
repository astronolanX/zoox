# Spark UX Sparks

Thread exploring: How the spark experience could evolve—output surfaces, organization, interaction patterns.

## Timeline

## Thread Synthesis

Two 85% signals agreed independently[^1][^2]: get sparks out of linear chat into spatial/persistent surfaces. The engineering insight[^3] identifies the core mismatch—chat is ephemeral, sparks are meant to persist.

The token reduction spark adds a new tension: compression vs clarity[^4]. The apophatic approach ("subtract to reveal essence") suggests minimum viable sparks may be more powerful than comprehensive ones.

The loop spark questions whether iteration belongs in sparks at all[^5]. Maybe sparks are *intentionally* non-looping — the value is in the single pass, forcing commitment without refinement. Loops could live between tiers, in memory retrieval, or across sessions (threads as loops over time).

The naming spark[^6] inverts the question entirely: threads aren't collections of sparks but the *silence* between them. The negative space that frames provocation. This connects to reef's decay-as-identity: what persists is absence, not presence.

**Resolved:**
- Thread-based folder structure with `!SPARKS.md` master index
- Auto-open spark files in editor
- Footnotes for provenance tracking

**Open questions:**
- How do threads relate to sessions vs topics?
- Should thread synthesis auto-update or require manual curation?
- What's the minimum viable spark? (rapid mode? single model? structured output?)
- Should sparks loop within a run, or are they intentionally one-shot?
- Is thread-level iteration (re-sparking same topic) the right loop abstraction?

## Sparks

- [[2026-01-14-1025-spark-logging-to-canvas]] — Decouple from chat, auto-open in editor, thread-based organization
- [[2026-01-14-1045-token-efficient-sparks]] — Token reduction paths: rapid mode, single-model, structured output
- [[2026-01-14-1808-loop-in-spark]] — Loops may not belong; single-pass forces commitment; threads as loops over time
- [[2026-01-14-1812-thread-of-sparks]] — Threads are silence, not sparks; negative space as container
