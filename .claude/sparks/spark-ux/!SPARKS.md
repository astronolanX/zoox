# Spark UX Sparks

Thread exploring: How the spark experience could evolve—output surfaces, organization, interaction patterns.

## Timeline

| Date | Topic | Key Emergent Insight | Score |
|------|-------|---------------------|-------|
| 2026-01-14 | Spark logging to canvas vs chat | What if sparks fueled dynamic, living project blueprints? | 70% |
| 2026-01-14 | Better sparks with less tokens | What if tokenlessness sparks unprecedented creativity? | 70% |

## Thread Synthesis

Two 85% signals agreed independently[^1][^2]: get sparks out of linear chat into spatial/persistent surfaces. The engineering insight[^3] identifies the core mismatch—chat is ephemeral, sparks are meant to persist.

The token reduction spark adds a new tension: compression vs clarity[^4]. The apophatic approach ("subtract to reveal essence") suggests minimum viable sparks may be more powerful than comprehensive ones.

**Resolved:**
- Thread-based folder structure with `!SPARKS.md` master index
- Auto-open spark files in editor
- Footnotes for provenance tracking

**Open questions:**
- How do threads relate to sessions vs topics?
- Should thread synthesis auto-update or require manual curation?
- What's the minimum viable spark? (rapid mode? single model? structured output?)
