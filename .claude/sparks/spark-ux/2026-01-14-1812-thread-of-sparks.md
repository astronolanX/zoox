## Emergent Insight

> What if threads are not sparks, but silence?

If sparks are the noise—provocation, disruption, signal—then threads might be the negative space between them. A thread full of sparks isn't a "chain" or "sequence" but the silence that frames each spark. The thread is what doesn't speak.

This inverts the naming question entirely. We don't name the collection of sparks; we name the absence that holds them together. A thread of sparks is called... nothing. It's the pause between notes that makes music.

## Individual Perspectives

### Near Tier
- **ollama**: Chrono-thread weaving temporal loops
- **gemini**: Spark-cascade creating emergent patterns

### Mid Tier
- **groq**: Reality-fracturing chain reaction
- **groq2**: Chrono-Labyrinth: a portal to paradoxical time loops (65%)

### Far Tier
- **openrouter**: Existential thread unraveling meaning
- **perplexity**: Silence between provocations

## Thread Context

Third spark in spark-ux thread. Previous sparks explored:
1. Decoupling sparks from chat into spatial/persistent surfaces
2. Token efficiency through compression vs clarity tension
3. Loops don't belong within sparks; threads are temporal loops

This spark continues the meta-exploration: if sparks are one-shot and threads are loops, what is the container? The answer: silence, negative space, the frame rather than the content.

- [[2026-01-14-1808-loop-in-spark]] — sparks are haiku, they don't iterate
- Relates to reef's decay-as-identity: what persists is absence, not presence
