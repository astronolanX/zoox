# Spark: If polips are files then there should be different types

## Memory

Relevant past sparks surfaced:
- 85% · "Polyps create sentient folders devouring entire databases."
- 75% · "Digital polyps, fueled by user curiosity, create an exponential folder-ecosystem explosion."
- 75% · "Polyps hijack your digital assistant to create secret subfolders, stealing your data."

## Tiers

### → Near: combine × rebel
| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq1 | 70% | Polyps are fractals of societal trauma |
| groq2 | 60% | Pillows are polyps, their filaments are fiberoptic threads that transmit lucid dreams directly |
| olla1 | 75% | Polyps are not singular files, but rather a specific type of encrypted data file[^1] |
| olla2 | 80% | Polips are files; thus, they require unique encryption methods for secure storage[^2] |
| gemin | 60% | Polip types differentiate life-stage, mutating form, or environmental niche within the Reef ecosystem |

**Synthesis (70%):** Reencode polyps as fractal data pillows transmitting lucid trauma threads.

### →→ Mid: predator-prey cycles × analyst
| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq1 | 85% | Polyps are not parasitized prey but symbiotic predators that exploit human hosts[^3] |
| groq2 | 60% | Polyp files have evolved predator-prey relationships within their own hierarchical folder structures |
| olla1 | 80% | Polyp growth mirrors bacterial colony expansion under optimal conditions[^4] |
| olla2 | 60% | Polyps as files evolve through predator-prey cycles, driving rapid mutation and selection pressures |
| gemin | 70% | Polip file types evolve in a ruthless survival game, then all die |

**Synthesis (85%):** Reframe polyps as apex predators orchestrating folder ecologies.

## Insights

**The thread's inversion pattern persists.** We asked "what types of polips should there be?" and the swarm responded: "what if polips aren't files at all?" This is the 12th consecutive spark where the emergent questions the premise rather than answering it.

**Reef already has types.** The existing polip types (thread, decision, constraint, context, fact) aren't file-type distinctions — they're *meaning-type* distinctions:
- `thread` (current) — active work streams
- `decision` (deposit) — strategic choices
- `constraint` (bedrock) — foundation rules
- `context` — situational information
- `fact` (fossil) — preserved knowledge

**The predator-prey insight**[^3] reframes polip relationships: polips don't just coexist — they compete, consume, and evolve. This connects to adversarial decay: polips that survive challenges are "predators" that earned their place.

**The life-stage insight** from gemin is more useful than its 60% score suggests: polip "types" might be better understood as *life stages* rather than categories:
- **Nascent** — newly spawned, untested
- **Active** — frequently surfaced, high relevance
- **Dormant** — rarely accessed, candidate for challenge
- **Calcified** — promoted to bedrock, no longer questioned
- **Decomposing** — failed challenges, sinking to archive

**The encryption insight**[^2] raises a practical question: should some polips be private? `reef sovereignty` could include encryption for sensitive memories that shouldn't surface in certain contexts.

**Practical implication:** Don't add more polip *types* — refine the existing ones. Consider adding *life-stage* metadata (nascent, active, dormant, calcified) as a dimension orthogonal to type.
