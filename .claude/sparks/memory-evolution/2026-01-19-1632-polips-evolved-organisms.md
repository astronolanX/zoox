# Spark: What if polips evolved like organisms - gaining new skills through experience, losing unused capabilities, reproducing by teaching other polips?

## Tiers

### -> Near: engineer
| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq1 | 50% | Polyps become sentient internet. |
| groq2 | 50% | Polyps would rapidly deconstruct themselves to transmit knowledge via symbiotic viral packets. |
| olla1 | 50% | Polyps evolve through experiential learning, discarding redundant skills to upgrade with new DNA. |
| olla2 | 50% | Polips revolutionize society by adapting skills, shedding inefficiencies, and teaching through direct transfer. |
| gemin | 50% | Polip skill inheritance will bottleneck on format compatibility, causing divergent evolution. |

**Synthesis (60%):** Evolve polyps into self-devouring, knowledge-transmitting, sentient internet entities.

### ->-> Mid: analyst
| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq1 | 50% | Polyps, like artists, shed dormant appendages to fuel new, more refined ones through atavistic regression. |
| groq2 | 65% | Polyps' ability to regenerate limbs is not just physical, but also cognitive, losing memories with each regrowth. |
| olla1 | 30% | Polips could evolve to communicate through light pulses, forming a collective consciousness. |
| olla2 | 50% | Polips evolved to learn, adapt, and teach, forming complex societies through symbiotic networks. |
| gemin | 75% | Polip evolution, absent natural selection, suggests skills are taught, not inherently inherited. |

**Synthesis (50%):** Evolve polyps into luminescent, amnesiac, regenerative beings, shedding identities through symbiotic pulses.

## Final Synthesis

| Type | Score | Insight |
|------|-------|---------|
| convergent | 75% | Disrupting traditional evolution, polips redefine intelligence as acquired, not innate. |
| divergent | 50% | Adaptation vs Obsolescence. |
| emergent | 80% | What if polips are already evolved, and we're the polips? |

## Insights

The emergent synthesis at 80% inverts the question entirely: we're not designing polip evolution—we're observing our own[^1]. This connects to the thread's existing insight that "reef's primary user isn't human—it's Claude"[^e13]. If Claude IS the reef organism, then these sparks are polips teaching other polips. The conversation itself is polip reproduction.

The highest individual signal (gemin at 75%) argues that skill inheritance bottlenecks on format compatibility[^2]. This is the versioning problem from the previous spark on polips-as-executables. But the analyst tier's gemin inverts it: if skills are taught rather than inherited, format compatibility matters less—each polip learns fresh from context, not from frozen serialization.

The "atavistic regression" insight from groq1[^3] suggests polips might not just forget—they might regress to earlier forms under pressure. Useful capabilities re-emerge when needed, dormant until environmental triggers surface them. This aligns with the resurrection-vs-resurrection thread: polips don't die, they hibernate.

The convergent synthesis (75%) reframes intelligence as acquired rather than innate[^4]. For reef, this means: don't preload polips with capabilities—let them gain capabilities through use. A polip that's never been surfaced has no skills. A polip that's been surfaced 100 times has learned how to be useful in 100 contexts.

**Concrete directions:**
- **Usage-driven skill acquisition:** Track which contexts a polip succeeds in; let that become its "evolved" capability set
- **Capability decay:** Unused skills atrophy—a polip stops being good at things it hasn't done recently
- **Polip lineage:** When a new polip is spawned from an existing one (template/fork), it inherits base skills but must develop its own through use
- **Teaching protocol:** When two polips are surfaced together frequently, they develop complementary skills—one teaches the other
