# Spark: What if AI memory systems evolved their own schemas?

## Tiers

### → Near: coral reef × pragmatist
| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq | 70% | Coral-like AI memory adapts through iterative error correction. |
| ollama | 70% | AI schemas evolve like coral colonies adapt to environmental changes. |
| gemini | 50% | Evolving AI schemas risk creating complex, untraceable, and uncorrectable memory structures. |

**Synthesis (50%):** Evolving AI schemas balance adaptability and complexity through iterative error correction mechanisms.

### →→ Mid: attractors × poet
| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq | 40% | Attractors in AI memory systems might stabilize into fractal attractor landscapes. |
| ollama | 50% | Artificial minds might dream, creating loops of thought. |
| gemini | 40% | Evolved schemas might poetically draw AI memory towards new, unexpected meaning. |

**Synthesis (60%):** Fractals emerge as AI minds dream, weaving unexpected meaning into memory landscapes.

### →→→ Far: antifragility × skeptic
| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq | 40% | AI systems would fail less. |
| ollama | 75% | Unpredictable AI schema evolution would amplify systemic brittleness, not resilience. |
| gemini | 60% | Evolved AI schemas risk amplifying existing biases, challenging claimed antifragility. |

**Synthesis (50%):** Evolutionary AI schemas balance resilience and brittleness amidst bias amplification risks.

## Final Synthesis

| Type | Score | Insight |
|------|-------|---------|
| ∩ convergent | 70% | Evolution risks destabilizing AI memory systems. |
| ⊗ divergent | 50% | Resilience vs brittleness. |
| ◈ emergent | 70% | What if AI memory created autonomous, self-healing poetry? |

## Insights

The "coral reef" lens appearing for reef project was serendipitous—the metaphor hits home. Key tensions worth pursuing:

**Path dependence warning:** The skeptic's highest signal[^1] warns that schema evolution could amplify brittleness. Reef's versioned polips (`v="2"`) are already a form of schema evolution—each session deposits new structures that future sessions inherit.

**Error correction vs complexity:** The pragmatist's insight[^2] about iterative error correction maps directly to reef's `sync --fix` command. But the warning about "untraceable structures"[^3] is real—as polips accumulate, debugging the context graph becomes harder.

**The emergent question:** "What if AI memory created autonomous, self-healing poetry?" suggests polips could self-organize, merge, or prune without explicit commands. LRU tracking is a primitive version of this—frequently-accessed polips get boosted.

**Design implication:** Consider adding a "reef health" metric that detects schema drift or complexity creep before it becomes problematic.
