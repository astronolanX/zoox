# Spark: What if reef riffed off Claude's inhouse plugin resume/rename/--resume/--continue?

## Memory

Related sparks in thread:
- 2026-01-14-1015 (70%) — Schema evolution → self-healing memory
- 2026-01-14-1020 (70%) — Sparks → autonomous ecosystems

The continuity question connects to both: how does memory persist across session boundaries?

## Insights

The chef metaphor[^1] is unexpectedly apt: session continuity isn't just about saving state—it's about **mise en place**. A chef doesn't resume cooking; they pick up where ingredients are prepped.

Three angles for reef to explore:

1. **Polip checkpointing**: `reef snapshot` before risky operations, `reef resume` to restore state
2. **Current threading**: A "current" polip could track session intent, not just activity—enabling smarter resumption
3. **Synergistic plugins**: If reef tracks what plugins/tools were active, resumption could auto-restore the full context

The emergent insight[^2] points to something bigger: session continuity as a **coordination mechanism** between plugins, not just memory persistence.
