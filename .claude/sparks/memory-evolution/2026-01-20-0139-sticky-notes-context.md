# Spark: What if sticky notes were the way context moved from one session to another

## Tiers

### → Near: historian

| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq1 | 70% | Sticky notes become sentient, replacing human memory entirely. |
| groq2 | 70% | Sticky notes catalyzed the rise of collective delusion on a global scale. |
| olla1 | 60% | Context migrates through sticky notes as symbiotic organisms on a digital canvas. |
| olla2 | 30% | Historians might argue sticky notes transform individual recollections into collective memory. |
| gemin | 60% | Before the telegraph, a man's thoughts, like sticky notes, physically moved with him. |

**Synthesis (70%):** Reimagine sticky notes as autonomous, reality-warping, symbiotic memory entities.

### →→ Mid: poet

| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq1 | 55% | Context is not stored on servers, but on fragments of human skin in scattered sticky note fragments. |
| groq2 | 60% | Contexts are ephemeral sticky notes adhering to our minds, disintegrating upon new thought. |
| olla1 | 70% | Children would scribble on walls, aliens would orbit. |
| olla2 | 70% | Sticky notes, ephemeral thoughts, transiently stored in the air. |
| gemin | 50% | Ephemeral memories, like stray sticky notes, cling to a digital reef, decaying into new forms. |

**Synthesis (70%):** Disintegrate servers, tattoo context on skin, and orbit ephemeral thoughts.

## Final Synthesis

| Type | Score | Insight |
|------|-------|---------|
| ∩ convergent | 70% | Subverting reality, humanity dissolves into ephemeral, fragmented thought. |
| ⊗ divergent | 25% | Chaos vs Order. |
| ◈ contrarian | 80% | What if sticky notes were utterly irrelevant? |
| → extends | 55% | Therefore, annotating sticky notes evolves into a new language system. |

## Insights

The contrarian inversion is the sharpest signal here: **What if sticky notes were utterly irrelevant?**

This challenges the premise directly. If context transfer matters, maybe the *mechanism* doesn't. The sticky note metaphor implies discreteness, portability, adhesion to surfaces. But context might be:
- **Ambient** — not discrete packets but atmospheric presence[^1]
- **Symbiotic** — living with the session rather than traveling between[^2]
- **Ephemeral by design** — meant to disintegrate, not persist[^3]

The historian lens surfaced something true: before networks, thoughts did travel physically with people. The telegram changed that. We might be at another inflection — where context doesn't *move* at all but *reconstitutes* from traces.

Polips already hint at this. They're not sticky notes passing between sessions. They're reef structures that sessions swim through.
