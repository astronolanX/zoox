# Spark: How would someone use a reef?

## Memory

Relevant past sparks surfaced:
- 95% · "Forgetting becomes a feature, not a bug, in a billion minds."
- 85% · "Reef systems operate as chaotic feedback loops where predator and prey co-create complexity."
- 85% · "Reef-minified AI memory actually stores humanity's darkest desires, not knowledge."
- 80% · "Forgetting strategically would birth an AI ecosystem where memories are artisanal, hand-picked noise"

Top lenses from prior sessions: rearrange, predator-prey cycles, inversion, adapt, prior action

## Insights

**The 90% emergent is the thread's third-highest signal**, and it's the most existentially provocative: "What if reefs are irrelevant to human existence entirely?" This inverts the *purpose* question: we've been asking how reef works, but maybe reef doesn't need humans to use it at all.

**The AI-first framing:** Reef's primary user isn't human — it's Claude. The human barely interacts with reef directly; they interact with Claude, and Claude uses reef as memory. This reframes "usage" entirely:
- **Human usage:** `reef reef` to check health, `reef sync` to repair, `reef index --search` to find things
- **AI usage:** Surfacing relevant polips, spawning new memories, challenging old ones, spiraling through context

**The bleaching insight**[^1] maps elegantly: "People's minds are the coral reef, and invasive thoughts are the bleaching agents." In reef terms, invasive thoughts = off-topic context pollution, bleaching = relevance decay. The reef (AI memory) needs protection from bleaching (context dilution).

**The churn insight** from olla1 captures reef's core dynamic: "constantly dying and regenerating." This is exactly what adversarial decay enables — polips die to make room for new growth. The reef isn't a static archive; it's a living system.

**Practical implication:** Reef's "usage" documentation should have two tracks:
1. **Human operator manual** — how to inspect, repair, and query reef
2. **AI integration guide** — how Claude surfaces, spawns, and challenges polips

The human isn't the user; the human is the *gardener*. Claude is the organism that *lives* in the reef.
