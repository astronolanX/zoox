# Spark: What triggers resurrection? What makes a polip worth resurrecting?

## Memory

Relevant past sparks surfaced:
- 95% · "Forgetting becomes a feature, not a bug, in a billion minds."
- 90% · "A decayed reef becomes petroleum, fueling progress, not just lifeless sand."
- 85% · "Mycelium networks may actually accelerate reef collapse, not repair it."

| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq1 | 70% | Chaos rearranges polyps into resurrected beings[^1] |
| groq2 | 75% | Resurrection is triggered by the entropy of observer attention, not biological need[^2] |
| olla1 | 45% | The resurrection of a polyp is triggered by the symbiotic bond with its host's microbiome |
| olla2 | 60% | Resurrection happens when a polip transforms its mundane existence into something extraordinary |
| gemin | 65% | In 2150, polip resurrection will be a cheap computation, triggered by economic, not sentimental, val |

**Synthesis (60%):** Disrupt observer attention to unleash chaotic symbiosis that resurrects polyps.

## Insights

**The 60% emergent continues the thread's dissolution pattern** — but with lower confidence than previous sparks. We asked "what triggers resurrection?" and the swarm responded with a shrug: "what if resurrection is irrelevant?"

**This is the thread's first below-70% emergent since spark 5.** The philosophy may be exhausted. The swarm can't find a provocative angle because the frame itself has been dissolved: if decay is illusion and persistence is fiction, then "resurrection" is equally fictional.

**But the groq2 insight (75%) is implementable:** "Resurrection is triggered by the entropy of observer attention, not biological need."[^2] In Claude's context:

- **Observer attention = context relevance** — polips resurrect when they match the current query
- **Entropy of attention = topic drift** — as conversation shifts, different polips become relevant
- **Not biological need = not intrinsic value** — polip worth isn't inherent; it's contextual

**The economic frame** from gemin (65%) is also practical: "triggered by economic, not sentimental, value." In token economics:
- **Economic value = token efficiency** — resurrect polips that deliver signal per token
- **Not sentimental = not access history** — don't resurrect just because frequently used

**Practical resurrection criteria (derived):**

1. **Relevance to current context** — semantic similarity to query
2. **Token efficiency** — information density per token consumed
3. **Recency of last challenge** — polips that survived recent decay get priority
4. **Contrast value** — polips that provide perspective not already in context

**The thread's energy is dissipating.** 20 sparks deep, emergent scores are declining. This suggests the philosophy is complete and implementation should begin.
