# Spark: What if our sparks made tasks for a project to explore?

## Tiers

### → Near: sieve × analyst
| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq | 70% | Spark-generated tasks filter into prioritized clusters. |
| ollama | 60% | If sparks created tasks, our sieves would prioritize 'glitch' over 'insight'. |
| gemini | 50% | Sieving sparks yields targeted tasks, focusing project exploration with efficient precision. |

**Synthesis (50%):** Sifting sparks generates paradoxical tasks, prioritizing glitches alongside targeted insights.

### →→ Mid: crystallization × historian
| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq | 60% | Historians would categorize spark-driven tasks into distinct crystalline project phases. |
| ollama | 70% | Projects crystallize when individuals combine diverse sparks into structured tasks, forming— |
| gemini | 60% | Task automation risks calcification of project goals, obscuring historical context. |

**Synthesis (75%):** Synthesizing sparks into tasks risks calcifying project goals, yet reveals historic context.

### →→→ Far: librarian's view × visionary
| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq | 70% | Sparks cataloged ignite innovative project workflows. |
| ollama | 50% | Catalyzing collective sparks into curricular design patterns optimizes project-based learning ecosys— |
| gemini | 50% | AI-generated tasks could curate project explorations like a librarian guides discovery. |

**Synthesis (60%):** Spark-driven curricula ignite project workflows, fueled by AI-generated task curation.

## Final Synthesis

| Type | Score | Insight |
|------|-------|---------|
| ∩ convergent | 70% | Sparks unify project tasks through prioritization and automation. |
| ⊗ divergent | 35% | Structure vs Chaos. |
| ◈ emergent | 70% | What if sparks self-organized into autonomous project ecosystems? |

## Insights

**The sieve paradox:** The analyst's counterintuitive take[^1]—"prioritize glitch over insight"—suggests spark-to-task pipelines shouldn't just extract clean action items. They should flag weird outliers that deserve investigation. Glitches are where assumptions break.

**Calcification warning:** The highest signal in this spark[^2] warns that automating sparks→tasks could freeze goals prematurely. Solution: tasks should be *suggestions* with expiration, not commitments. Consider adding `tentative` status to reef's polip system.

**Librarian curation:** Not all sparks deserve tasks[^3]. A scoring threshold could filter: only emergent insights above 70% become candidate tasks.

**Implementation path:**
1. Parse spark logs for high-signal emergent insights (≥70%)
2. Generate candidate polips with `type="task"` and `tentative="true"`
3. Surface in next session as "sparks suggest exploring..."
4. User confirms or dismisses; dismissed sparks decay in priority via LRU

**Meta-observation:** This spark is recursive—we're sparking about how sparks could make tasks, and the emergent insight ("self-organizing ecosystems") points back to reef's core purpose.
