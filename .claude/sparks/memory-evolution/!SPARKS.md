# Memory Evolution Sparks

Thread exploring: How AI memory systems (reef, polips) could evolve, self-organize, and generate their own structures.

## Timeline

| Date | Topic | Key Emergent Insight | Score |
|------|-------|---------------------|-------|
| 2026-01-14 | AI memory systems evolving schemas | What if AI memory created autonomous, self-healing poetry? | 70% |
| 2026-01-14 | Sparks making tasks for projects | What if sparks self-organized into autonomous project ecosystems? | 70% |
| 2026-01-14 | reef + Claude's session continuity | What if resuming workflows sparks autonomous plugin synergies? | 70% |

## Thread Synthesis

Three sparks converge on **autonomy**: memory systems that don't just store but actively organize, heal, and generate[^e1][^e2]. The third adds a new dimension: **cross-plugin coordination**[^e3].

The brittleness warning[^1] counters naive optimism about self-evolving schemas. The calcification warning[^2] suggests any spark→task automation needs decay mechanisms. The chef metaphor[^3] reframes continuity as mise en place, not just state restoration.

**Key questions:**
- How much schema evolution before brittleness?
- Should sparks generate tasks, or just surface patterns?
- What's the right balance between persistence and decay?
- Can session continuity become a coordination layer between plugins?
