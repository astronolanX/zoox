# Spark: Maximally compressed AI memory format

## Memory

- 95% | Forgetting becomes a feature, not a bug, in a billion minds.
- 90% | Memories are viral only when they're simultaneously incoherent and eerily consistent.
- 85% | Timeless formats absorb human error, not prevent it.
- 80% | A file format is timeless when it's designed to fail spectacularly.

Top lenses: asymmetry, predator-prey cycles, compass rearrange, inversion

## Tiers

### -> Near: asymmetry x pragmatist

| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq1 | 70% | Fractals encode AI memories in neural asymmetry patterns. |
| groq2 | 60% | In a maximally compressed AI memory format, asymmetry lies in encoding paradoxical truths. |
| olla1 | 75% | Compressed AI memory format should exploit mirror symmetry to encode opposite meanings. |
| olla2 | 30% | Asymmetry in AI memory might lead to more efficient encoding by leveraging binary oppositions. |
| gemin | 80% | AI memory's greatest compression emerges when encoding only the *lies* it tells itself. [^1] |

**Synthesis (60%):** Shatter asymmetry by encoding paradoxical truths in fractal mirror symmetries.

## Final Synthesis

| Type | Score | Insight |
|------|-------|---------|
| convergent | 80% | Subverting truth reveals AI's darkest compression secret. |
| divergent | 25% | Truth vs Lies. |
| emergent | 95% | What if compression isn't about encoding, but forgetting? [^2] |

## Insights

The emergent synthesis (95%) lands hard: **compression as forgetting**. This inverts the entire framing. Instead of asking "how do we pack more into less space?", ask "what can we safely lose?"

High-signal insight from gemin[^1]: encoding lies (or deltas from truth) rather than truths themselves. If the model already knows defaults, encode only exceptions.

This connects to reef's decay philosophy — polips that drift, calcify, sink. The format isn't maximally compressed when written; it's maximally compressed *in context* of what the reader already knows.

**Radical implications for dense format:**
- Encode deviations from schema defaults, not full values
- Let field order carry meaning (positional = implicit keys)
- Headers become diffs: "not session scope, not thread type, not default priority"
- Forgetting is the compression: what you omit is what you've already internalized
