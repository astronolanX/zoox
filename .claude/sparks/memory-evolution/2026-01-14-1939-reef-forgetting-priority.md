# Spark: What should a reef forget first

## Memory

| Score | Related Insight |
|-------|-----------------|
| 95% | Forgetting becomes a feature, not a bug, in a billion minds. |
| 90% | A decayed reef becomes petroleum, fueling progress, not just lifeless sand. |
| 85% | Mycelium networks may actually accelerate reef collapse, not repair it. |
| 85% | Polyps are not parasitized prey but symbiotic predators that exploit human hosts. |
| 80% | Polyp growth mirrors bacterial colony expansion under optimal conditions. |

*top lenses: rearrange, predator-prey cycles, compass, inversion, adapt*

| groq1 | 60% | Forget fish, prioritize thermal memory. |
| groq2 | 45% | A reef should forget the habit of stabilizing, allowing wild temperature fluctuations. |
| olla1 | 50% | Reef should forget its "thermostat" mechanism to prevent coral bleaching in oscillating temperatures. |
| olla2 | 55% | A reef should forget its thermostat, embracing chaos to rejuvenate. |
| gemin | 35% | A reef thermostat forgets user temperature preferences, prioritizing overall system stability. |

**Synthesis (85%):** Abandon thermostat-like stability to unleash chaotic temperature fluctuations.

## Insights

The swarm chose thermostat as the primary lens — a homeostatic mechanism. The consensus (80% convergent): **forget self-regulation first**. A reef that maintains stability is a reef that resists change.

The tier synthesis (85%) sharpens this: abandon thermostat-like stability to unleash chaotic temperature fluctuations. In reef terms: stop trying to maintain consistency. Let polips fluctuate. Let context get messy. The chaos is generative.

The emergent (60%) questions the premise itself: what if reefs have no memory to forget? This connects to spark 19's "decay as illusion" — if polips are resurrected not remembered, there's nothing to forget. The question dissolves.

**Implementation direction:**
- Don't build a "forget X first" priority queue
- Build a "stop stabilizing X" disengagement mechanism
- Reef's thermostat is the glob surfacing — maybe it should fluctuate more wildly, not maintain consistency
