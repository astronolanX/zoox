# Spark: What if the incubator's composite scoring is selecting for safety instead of insight

## Tiers

### → Near: skeptic
| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq1 | 85% | Incubators breed timid minds, not visionaries |
| groq2 | 35% | The incubator's composite scoring favors 'compliance' over 'innovation', stifling genuine discovery |
| olla1 | 35% | The incubator's composite scoring prioritizes stability over innovation, breeding complacent mediocrity |
| olla2 | 40% | If incubators favor safety over insight, they might stifle true innovation and progress |
| gemin | 50% | Incubators calcify, rewarding predictable safety over transformative, disruptive insight |

**Synthesis (60%):** Disrupt the incubator's scoring to unleash visionary risk-takers over complacent safety-seekers.

### →→ Mid: analyst
| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq1 | 70% | The incubator's true purpose is to cultivate fragility, not genius |
| groq2 | 50% | The incubator's composite scoring inadvertently cultivates mediocre ideas that are easy to kill |
| olla1 | 60% | Incubators prioritize safety over insight because investors fear failure more than they value innovation |
| olla2 | 60% | Children would notice if incubators prioritized safety over insight because it stifles creativity |
| gemin | 65% | Safety, enforced by composite scoring, paradoxically incubates brittle conformism, not resilient insight |

**Synthesis (50%):** Disrupt incubators that prioritize survivability over revolutionary insight, cultivating mediocrity instead of genius.

## Final Synthesis

| Type | Score | Insight |
|------|-------|---------|
| ∩ convergent | 70% | Subverting innovation, incubators suffocate genius with safety |
| ⊗ divergent | 50% | Innovation vs. Stability |
| ◈ contrarian | 70% | What if safety is the ultimate insight? |
| → extends | 45% | Reweight scoring to prioritize disruptive potential over stability metrics |

## Insights

The contrarian at 70%[^1] inverts the premise elegantly: what if "safe" ideas that survive are actually more valuable than "disruptive" ideas that flame out? Survival is information. The incubator's selection pressure may be correct — we're just labeling it wrong.

The "timid minds" framing[^2] reveals the bias: we assume disruption = value. But the incubator's composite scoring (feasibility × importance × innovation) explicitly penalizes impractical novelty. Is that wrong, or is it wisdom?

**The selection pressure problem:** The incubator's FII scoring rewards:
- F (Feasibility): Can it be built?
- I (Importance): Does it matter?
- I (Innovation): Is it new?

High-F scores favor incremental improvements. Low-F visionary ideas die early. But most visionary ideas *should* die — 99% are noise. The 1% signal gets lost in the filter, but so does 99% waste.

**Concrete direction:** Add a "heresy score" — explicitly track and preserve ideas that fail traditional scoring but score high on contrarian/inversive potential. Let the main incubator select for safety; create a shadow incubator for dangerous ideas.
