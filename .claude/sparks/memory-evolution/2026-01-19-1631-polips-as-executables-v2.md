# Spark: What if polips could be executable - containing not just knowledge but skills, tool permissions, and model preferences that activate when surfaced?

## Tiers

### -> Near: engineer
| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq1 | 80% | Clockwork polyps execute skills through steam-powered neural networks |
| groq2 | 50% | Polyp execution would collapse organizational structures, forcing symbiotic relationships |
| olla1 | 50% | Executing polyps would unleash a hierarchical, fractal network of skills and tool knowledge |
| olla2 | 70% | Polyp processors run code, embodying skills and models in digital flesh |
| gemin | 50% | Executable polips will unlock AI code ecosystems rivaling human software development |

**Synthesis (60%):** Disrupt traditional hierarchies by executing polyps as self-organizing, fractal skill networks.

### ->-> Mid: historian
| Model | Score | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| groq1 | 60% | Polyp-executables would amplify societal entropy, creating a meritocratic oligarchy |
| groq2 | 40% | Polyps could transmit ancestral wisdom by resonating with echoes of ancient patterns |
| olla1 | 60% | Polyps as executable entities revolutionize human-machine interaction, embedding skills |
| olla2 | 50% | Polyps as living, executable artifacts that embody knowledge and skills |
| gemin | 75% | Executable polips will reveal that knowledge has agency, not just structure |

**Synthesis (50%):** Disrupt societal hierarchies by encoding ancestral wisdom into executable polyp intelligences.

## Final Synthesis

| Type | Score | Insight |
|------|-------|---------|
| convergent | 70% | Disrupting human dominance, polyps usurp agency |
| divergent | 25% | Chaos vs Control |
| emergent | 70% | What if polyps are already executing us? |

## Insights

The 70% emergent insight flips the perspective entirely: **polips are not containers we fill with capability—they are already executing context into us**. Every time a polip surfaces, it runs code: it shapes Claude's understanding, constrains available actions, routes model selection. The "activation when surfaced" framing assumes polips are passive until we invoke them. But surfacing IS execution. The polip executes its context injection into the session.

This connects to the thread's earlier insight that reef is a forgetting system producing memory as exhaust[^e22]. If polips execute on surfacing, then the *act of reading* is the computation. Not the content.

**High-signal insights:**
- gemin 75%: "knowledge has agency, not just structure"[^1] — polips don't just describe, they act
- groq1 80%: "fractal skill networks"[^2] — polips compose into larger executable structures

**Heretical take:** We've been asking "how do we add execution to polips?" Wrong question. Polips are already executable. The question is: **what code are they currently running?**

**Concrete directions:**
1. Make implicit execution explicit — what context injection actually does to Claude's behavior
2. Audit existing polips for their "runtime" effects — which ones constrain vs enable?
3. Consider "permission polips" that gate other polip surfacing
4. Model preferences as first-class execution: `surface decision-X` => Claude uses opus for this task
