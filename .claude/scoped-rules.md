## Scope: ~

# Global Context

Universal preferences that apply everywhere.

## Communication

- Be direct — skip preamble
- Verify plans before significant changes
- Search proactively when knowledge may be stale

## Code Style

- Clear function names that describe actions
- Simple names — implementation details stay internal
- No over-engineering — only what's needed

## Session

- Check for stale worktrees at session start
- Clean up before session end (dev servers, branches)
