GOOPY VISION DOCUMENT SUMMARY
Date: 2026-01-08 | Priority: P3 | Confidence: Variable

CORE INSIGHT:
Blobs are a lightweight coordination protocol with built-in
relevance scoring, temporal awareness, and semantic linking.

HIGH CONFIDENCE INNOVATIONS (0.80+):
- IN_PROGRESS status for swarm task claiming (0.90)
- Design workflow mapping via existing types (0.88)
- Time-travel snapshots with goopy snapshot/restore (0.85)
- Hierarchical globs for 10K+ scaling (0.82)

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE INNOVATIONS (0.60-0.79):
- PM/Kanban workflow mapping (0.75)
- Context compression via rollup blobs (0.70)
- Semantic auto-linking via file overlap (0.65)
- Consensus building via VOTE extension (0.60)

LOW CONFIDENCE / SPECULATIVE (<0.60):
- Personal productivity (meal planning, etc.) (0.55)
- Cross-project pattern mining (0.45)
- CRDT fields for real-time collaboration (0.40)
- Privacy-preserving shared context (0.35)

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (This Sprint):
1. Add IN_PROGRESS status (1 line code change)
2. Document design/PM patterns in README
3. Add goopy snapshot command

RESEARCH CONTEXT:
- 72% enterprise AI uses multi-agent (up from 23% in 2024)
- "Disconnected models problem" = biggest barrier to autonomy
- Goopy fills niche between flat CLAUDE.md and database solutions

PHILOSOPHY:
Remain lightweight while enabling emergent patterns.
Swarm coordination, PM workflows, knowledge graphs all
emerge from composable primitives (status + scope + refs).
