GOOPY ARCHITECTURE CRITIQUE SUMMARY
Date: 2026-01-08 | Priority: P1 | Confidence: 0.88

HIGH FINDINGS:
[HIGH] Hardcoded subdirectory lists (4+ locations) - Already caused bugs

MEDIUM FINDINGS:
[MEDIUM] CLI/Glob decompose mismatch - Deletes vs archives

LOW FINDINGS:
[LOW] XML token overhead - ~50% larger than JSON (acceptable trade-off)

ARCHITECTURE STRENGTHS:
- Simplicity: 850 LOC for full functionality
- Zero dependencies: Well-maintained constraint
- Schema versioning: Migration path defined
- Graceful degradation: Malformed files skipped
- Separation of concerns: Blob/Glob/CLI clean

RECOMMENDATIONS:
P1: Centralize KNOWN_SUBDIRS constant
P1: Unify decompose behavior (CLI should archive, not delete)
P3: Document XML vs JSON trade-off

FILES TO MODIFY:
- src/goopy/blob.py (add KNOWN_SUBDIRS, use in 3 places)
- src/goopy/cli.py (use Glob.decompose instead of unlink)
- README.md (add "Why XML?" section)

COMPARISON:
vs Claude-Mem: More complex (SQLite, AI compression)
vs MCP Memory: More complex (cross-tool, embeddings)
vs CLAUDE.md: Less structured (flat text, no scoring)
Verdict: Goopy fills unique niche between flat files and databases
