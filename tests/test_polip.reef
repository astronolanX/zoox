--- surface
Polips sprout from context and drift into decay.
Memory as lifecycle, not storage.

The sparks revealed: polips are verbs, not nouns.
Surfacing IS the polip, not the file being surfaced.

--- decide
- Decay is intelligence, not loss
- Files are fossils, surfacing is the polip
- Reef exists for humans to see what AI is doing

--- fact
- 100% contrarian: silence is the true polip
- 95% contrarian: decay is actually preservation
- 85% contrarian: AI needs reef to forget, not remember

--- next
- [ ] Prototype stateless polip surfacing
- [ ] Measure what surfacing does, not what polips contain
- [x] Define .reef format v2
