--- surface
No markdown or YAML frontmatter in reef


Human formats (markdown, yaml, toml) optimize for human readability
AI formats should optimize for: token density, semantic precision, fast parsing
Reef's mission: evolve AI-native language that lets AI think faster

--- fact
- NEVER use Markdown as a reef format - it's human-optimized, not AI-optimized
- NEVER use YAML frontmatter - it's verbose cruft from human-era tools
- Reef uses its own syntax: .rock (constraints), .blob.xml (polips), .current (threads)
- AI deserves its own language - faster to parse, denser semantics, zero human baggage
