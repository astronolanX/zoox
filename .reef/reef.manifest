# reef doesn't impose structure
# polips exist, relationships emerge
# this manifest is the only metadata

# projections generate LLM-specific views:
#   reef project claude  → CLAUDE.md
#   reef project ollama  → ollama context
#   reef project gpt     → system prompt

# the reef is the source
# everything else is projection

# memory strategy - experiments in forgetting
# options: default, decay, resurrect, inverse, empty
strategy: empty

# surfacing mode - how much context to inject
# options: full, index, presence
mode: presence
