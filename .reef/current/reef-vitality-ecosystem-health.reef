Reef Vitality: Ecosystem Health Through Content Flow

Reefs should function as living indicators of knowledge ecosystem health. Growth signals come from meaningful human-AI resonance, not just accumulation. Content quality matters - toxic patterns trigger reef responses. The human's voice and thinking patterns should strengthen through inference interactions that truly assimilate, not just append.

--- decide
- Reef vitality is measured by content quality flow, not just volume
- Growth = inference resonance with human voice, not polip count
- Toxic content triggers reef responses (pruning, isolation, warnings)
- Human signal strength is a core vitality metric

--- fact
- Living systems respond to environmental signals - reefs should too
- Content flow creates health signals: stagnation, toxicity, or thriving growth
- AI inference that resonates with human thought patterns indicates quality assimilation
- Voice consistency and strength emerge from aligned inference inflections
- Toxic content accumulation is a reef health problem, not just storage issue

--- next
- [ ] Define "toxic content" signals: stale, contradictory, low-resonance polips
- [ ] Implement vitality scoring: voice consistency + inference alignment + content freshness
- [ ] Build reef response mechanisms: auto-prune low-vitality polips, flag conflicts
- [ ] Create resonance metrics: track which polips strengthen vs weaken human signal
- [ ] Add "reef health" command showing vitality score, content flow patterns, toxic signals
- [ ] Implement voice signature tracking: detect when AI inflections align with human patterns
