  <summary>Reef Vitality: Ecosystem Health Through Content Flow</summary>
  <context>Reefs should function as living indicators of knowledge ecosystem health. Growth signals come from meaningful human-AI resonance, not just accumulation. Content quality matters - toxic patterns trigger reef responses. The human's voice and thinking patterns should strengthen through inference interactions that truly assimilate, not just append.</context>
  <facts>
    <fact>Living systems respond to environmental signals - reefs should too</fact>
    <fact>Content flow creates health signals: stagnation, toxicity, or thriving growth</fact>
    <fact>AI inference that resonates with human thought patterns indicates quality assimilation</fact>
    <fact>Voice consistency and strength emerge from aligned inference inflections</fact>
    <fact>Toxic content accumulation is a reef health problem, not just storage issue</fact>

    <decision>Reef vitality is measured by content quality flow, not just volume</decision>
    <decision>Growth = inference resonance with human voice, not polip count</decision>
    <decision>Toxic content triggers reef responses (pruning, isolation, warnings)</decision>

## Reef as Living System

**Core Metaphor:** Coral reefs thrive or die based on water quality. Knowledge reefs thrive or die based on content quality.

### Vitality Signals

**Healthy Growth:**
- Polips reference each other naturally (organic linking)
- New content builds on existing patterns (inference alignment)
- Access patterns show sustained engagement (not one-off dumps)
- Constraints and decisions remain stable (foundational strength)

**Toxic Patterns:**
- Contradictory polips (decision X conflicts with decision Y)
- Stale session contexts never accessed (dead tissue)
- Low-resonance content: created but never surfaced
- Voice drift: new content doesn't match established patterns

### Response Mechanisms

**Reef Reactions:**
1. **Bleaching** - Stale content loses priority in surfacing
2. **Pruning** - Auto-archive polips with sustained low vitality
3. **Quarantine** - Flag contradictory content for resolution
4. **Regeneration** - Calcification merges related high-vitality content

### Human Voice Signal

**What Strengthens Signal:**
- Consistent terminology and phrasing patterns
- Decision polips that hold over time (stability)
- Frequent surfacing/usage of specific polips (validation)
- Natural linking patterns (organic thought connections)

**What Weakens Signal:**
- One-off content never revisited
- Contradictory decisions within short timeframe
- Abandoned threads (started but never progressed)
- Import of content that doesn't fit existing voice

### Inference Resonance

**Quality Assimilation:** When AI-generated content naturally extends human thought patterns, showing understanding of context, constraints, and voice.

**Indicators:**
- Surfaced polips get accessed multiple times
- New content links to existing foundation
- Decisions cascade naturally (B builds on A)
- Thread progression shows coherent evolution

**Anti-patterns:**
- Generic AI content (could be anyone's voice)
- Polips that contradict established constraints
- Content created but never integrated
- Excessive polip creation without consolidation

    <step>Define "toxic content" signals: stale, contradictory, low-resonance polips</step>
    <step>Implement vitality scoring: voice consistency + inference alignment + content freshness</step>
    <step>Build reef response mechanisms: auto-prune low-vitality polips, flag conflicts</step>
    <step>Create resonance metrics: track which polips strengthen vs weaken human signal</step>
    <step>Add "reef health" command showing vitality score, content flow patterns, toxic signals</step>
    <step>Implement voice signature tracking: detect when AI inflections align with human patterns</step>
