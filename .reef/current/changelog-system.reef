Changelog system design: vendor introspection of scriv/towncrier/git-cliff with polip-native implementation plan


Design research for reef's PyPI release changelog system. Uses introspection pattern to analyze vendor tools and cherry-pick their best qualities while maintaining zero-dependency constraint.
## Core Insight
Polips ARE changelog fragments. Session context polips already capture what changed, why, and what's next. A `reef changelog` command aggregates these into keepachangelog format.
## Vendor Quality Extraction
| Vendor | Quality | Adopt? |
|--------|---------|--------|
| scriv | Fragment-per-PR workflow | Yes - polips = fragments |
| scriv | create/collect/github-release | Yes - CLI commands |
| towncrier | CI check command | Yes - `reef changelog check` |
| towncrier | Issue linking | Optional - `--issue` flag |
| git-cliff | SemVer detection | Yes - from change categories |
| git-cliff | PR metadata fetching | Yes - `--fetch-prs` |
| keepachangelog | Standard format | Yes - output format |
## Proposed CLI
```bash
reef changelog create         # Create changelog polip
reef changelog                # Show unreleased
reef changelog collect        # Aggregate to CHANGELOG.md
reef changelog check          # CI: require changelog
reef changelog release        # Collect + tag + bump
```
## Polip Schema Addition
Optional `<changelog>` element with Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed sections.
Falls back to summary + decisions if missing.
## Configuration
```toml
[tool.reef.changelog]
categories = ["Added", "Changed", "Fixed", "Removed"]
fragment_directory = ".claude/changelog"
output_file = "CHANGELOG.md"
```

--- decide
- Build polip-native changelog instead of depending on scriv/towncrier
- Use reef's own polip system as changelog fragments
- Cherry-picked best qualities from scriv (workflow), towncrier (CI), git-cliff (SemVer), keepachangelog (format)
- Implementation postponed - this is design reference only

--- next
- [ ] When ready: implement Phase 1 (CHANGELOG.md bootstrap)
- [ ] Then Phase 2 (CLI commands)
- [ ] Phase 3 (polip schema) and Phase 4 (automation) can follow
